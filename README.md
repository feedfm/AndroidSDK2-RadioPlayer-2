# AndroidSDK2-RadioPlayer-2
Radio player 2 for Feed.FM Android SDK v2

This is our second Android app that makes use of the Feed Media SDK to power a Pandora-style Internet-radio app. This app shows how you can easily display a scrolling grid of music stations that the user can click to hear.

This player will retrieve the list of stations to display from the server, along with station meta-data that defines background images and descriptive text.

This is the Android equivalent of [iOS RadioPlayer2](https://github.com/feedfm/iOS-RadioPlayer-2)
